learning to code...
I followed the instruction from the Youtube video, "Node.js With Passport Authentication | Full Project,"
made by Traversy Media, https://youtu.be/6FOq4cUdH8k

'package.json' and the css links in 'views/layout.ejs' were changed in order to make this project work in the actual server.
It didn't work out though...
